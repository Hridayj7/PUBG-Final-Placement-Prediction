## Business Objective

To develop a machine learning model that predicts the pecrntage of final placement of players in the popular online multiplayer game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). The goal of this project is to provide players with insights into their potential performance based on various in-game factors and to enhance their overall gaming experience as well as to help them make strategic decisions during gameplay by adjusting their gameplay strategies, increase their chances of achieving higher placements, and ultimately enhance their satisfaction and engagement with the game. 


## Problem Statement

In the competitive gaming arena, players, teams, and enthusiasts seek efficient ways to boost performance and gain an edge. Extracting valuable insights from gameplay data is key for self-improvement, strategic choices, and skill growth. The demand for data-driven analysis to refine training strategies in the dynamic online gaming landscape is also on the rise. This project leverages machine learning and analytics to offer actionable insights, reshaping how competitive gaming is strategized and executed.
## Approach 
The data was sourced from Kaggle.com and underwent thorough preprocessing and feature engineering before the exploratory data analysis phase. Subsequently, the data was divided into training and testing sets for model development. Model evaluation was conducted using suitable metrics, and the trained model was then employed to make predictions for the final placements in the testing dataset.
## Skills & Tools
Python Programming, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization,  Machine Learning Libraries, Model Evaluation, etc.
